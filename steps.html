        <h1>The 3-Step Manifestation Process</h1> 
        <p class="intro-steps"> 
            Effective manifestation is a simple, repeatable cycle. Follow these three phases 
consistently to align your energy and take inspired action toward your goals. 
        </p> 
 
        <section class="step-card"> 
            <h2>Step 1: The Clarity Phase - Define Your Intention</h2> 
            <p>Before the universe can deliver, you must be absolutely specific. Vague intentions 
yield vague results.</p> 
             
            <ol class="step-list"> 
                <li><strong>Write it Down (Present Tense):</strong> Frame your desire as if it has 
already happened.</li> 
                <li><strong>Add Sensory Details:</strong> Describe what it <strong>Feels</strong> like. What do you 
see, hear, taste, and touch when this desire is real?</li> 
                <li><strong>Identify "Why":</strong> Understand the core reason you want this goal, 
as this fuels your emotional energy.</li> 
            </ol> 
        </section> 
 
        <section class="step-card step-card-colored"> 
            <h2>Step 2: The Elevation Phase - Raise Your Vibration</h2> 
            <p>Your inner state dictates what you attract. Use tools to raise your emotional energy 
to match your desire.</p> 
             
            <ul class="step-list"> 
                <li><strong>Gratitude Journaling:</strong> Start and end your day by listing three 
things you are truly grateful for.</li> 
                <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Spend 5-10 minutes deeply imagining your 
desired outcome every day.</li> 
                <li><strong>Release Limiting Beliefs:</strong> Actively replace thoughts of doubt 
with empowering affirmations.</li> 
            </ul> 
             
            <blockquote> 
                "What you think, you become. What you feel, you attract. What you imagine, you 
create." 
            </blockquote> 
        </section> 
 
        <section class="step-card"> 
            <h2>Step 3: Action & Release - Trust the Process</h2> 
            <p>Inspired action closes the gap between intention and reality. Do one thing today 
that moves you closer to your goal, then trust the timing of the universe.</p> 
             
            <ul class="step-list"> 
                <li><strong>Listen for Intuition:</strong> Be alert for sudden nudges or ideas—these 
are your inspired actions.</li> 
                <li><strong>Take Uncomfortable Action:</strong> Do the necessary work without 
attachment to the outcome.</li> 
                <li><strong>Let Go of "How":</strong> Release the need to control the path. Focus 
on the <strong>What</strong> (the goal), not the <strong>How</strong> (the mechanics).</li> 
            </ul>
